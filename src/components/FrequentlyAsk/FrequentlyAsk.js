                            React goes through its virtual DOM ,creates a list of those changes that need to be made to the actual DOM and then does it all in one single process.React does not commit state changes one after the other if there are multiple state changes.
                            In fancy words, React does batch updates.React js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

                       <strong>Props:-</strong> 

                        Props are read-only components. It is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes. It allows passing data from one component to other components. It is similar to function arguments and can be passed to the component the same way as arguments passed in a function. Props are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component.

                            <strong>State:-</strong> 

                        The state is an updatable structure that is used to contain data or information about the component and can change over time. The change in state can happen as a response to user action or system event. It is the heart of the react component which determines the behavior of the component and how it will render. A state must be kept as simple as possible. It represents the component's local state or information. It can only be accessed or modified inside the component or by the component directly.

                        useState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value.
